## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the values in `.env` with your actual configuration.

### Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
